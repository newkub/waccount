# Project Goal: Account Management System for Wrikka.com

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust, secure, and user-friendly account management system for the wrikka.com ecosystem. This system will serve as the central hub for all user-related activities.

## Key Objectives:

- **Centralized Authentication**: Provide a single point of entry for users, supporting various authentication methods including email/password and OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) via WorkOS.

- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to view and manage their personal information, including name, email, and profile picture.

- **Account Security**: Enable users to manage their account security settings, such as changing their password.

- **Seamless User Experience (UX)**: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user journey, from registration and login to profile management and account settings.

- **Developer-Friendly & Maintainable**: Build the application on a modern, scalable tech stack (Nuxt 3, TypeScript, UnoCSS) with a clean, modular architecture that is easy to maintain and extend.
